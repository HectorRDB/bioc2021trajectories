# Workshop Description

In single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), gene expression is assessed at the level of single cells. In dynamic biological systems, it may not be appropriate to assign cells to discrete groups, but rather a continuum of cell states may be observed, e.g. the differentiation of a stem cell population into mature cell types. This is often represented as a trajectory in reduced dimension.

Many methods have been suggested for trajectory inference. However, in this setting, it is often unclear how one should handle multiple biological groups or conditions, e.g. constructing and comparing the differentiation trajectory of a wild type versus a knock-out stem cell population.

In this workshop, we will explore methods for comparing multiple conditions in a trajectory inference analysis. We start by integrating datasets from multiple conditions into a single trajectory. By comparing the conditions along the trajectory's path, we can detect large-scale changes, indicative of differential progression. We also demonstrate how to detect subtler changes by finding genes that exhibit different behaviors between these conditions along a differentiation path.

[This vignette](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/slingshot/inst/doc/conditionsVignette.html) provides a more complete problem description and proposes a few analytical approaches, which will serve as the basis of our workshop.

## Pre-requisites

Software:

* Basic knowledge of _R_ syntax
* Familiarity with single-cell RNA-sequencing
* Familiarity with the `SingleCellExperiment` class

Background reading:

* The textbook "Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor" is a great reference for single-cell analysis using Bioconductor packages.
* [Slingshot paper](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-018-4772-0)
* [tradeSeq paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14766-3)
* [condiments paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.09.433671v1)


## Workshop Participation

The workshop will start with an introduction to the problem and the dataset using presentation slides. Following this, we will have a lab session on how one may tackle the problem of handling multiple conditions in trajectory inference and in downstream analysis involving differential progression and differential expression.

## _R_ / _Bioconductor_ packages used

* The workshop will focus on Bioconductor packages [SingleCellExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SingleCellExperiment.html), [Slingshot](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/slingshot.html), [tradeSeq](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/tradeSeq.html) and [condiments](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/condiments.html).
